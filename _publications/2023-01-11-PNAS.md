This study explores the role of white-tailed deer (WTD) in New York State as a potential reservoir for SARS-CoV-2 variants, particularly those no longer prevalent in human populations, 
such as the Alpha, Delta, and Gamma variants. Through an extensive cross-sectional investigation, researchers collected and analyzed 5,462 samples from WTD during the 2020 and 2021 hunting 
seasons. A significant increase in SARS-CoV-2 infections was observed, with infection rates rising dramatically from 0.6% in 2020 to 21.1% in 2021, revealing that the virus was circulating 
widely within the deer population.

Hotspots of infection were identified across New York, particularly in regions with dense deer populations. Spatial analyses showed that specific counties carried a higher relative risk of SARS-CoV-2 
infection in WTD, demonstrating a clustering effect of infections. Analyzing the distribution of infections among WTD, the study found that male deer, especially adult males, were at a higher risk of
infection than females, suggesting that certain behavioral or ecological factors may contribute to differential infection rates by sex and age.
Genetic sequencing of the virus in WTD samples revealed the cocirculation of multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants, including Alpha, Gamma, and Delta. This finding indicates that the virus had spilled over from human
 to WTD multiple times, and subsequent deer-to-deer transmission allowed these variants to persist in the deer population even after they had largely disappeared from humans. Phylogenetic analysis 
demonstrated that the SARS-CoV-2 lineages circulating in WTD were distinct from those in humans, with rapid adaptation observed in the virus within the deer population. Notably, the Gamma variant in
WTD formed a highly similar, localized cluster, while the Delta and Alpha variants showed greater genetic diversity and broader geographic distribution.

The study emphasizes the implications for public health, as WTD may serve as a long-term reservoir for SARS-CoV-2 variants, maintaining viral lineages that could potentially spill back into human populations. 
This poses a public health concern, especially considering the extensive contact between humans and deer in many regions. The findings underscore the necessity of continuous surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 in WTD 
to monitor viral evolution, understand transmission dynamics, and assess the risk of zoonotic transmission back to humans. The researchers recommend implementing measures to minimize the transmission of
SARS-CoV-2 between humans and wildlife, particularly in high-contact areas, to prevent the virus from establishing a stable reservoir in WTD that could facilitate future outbreaks in humans.
