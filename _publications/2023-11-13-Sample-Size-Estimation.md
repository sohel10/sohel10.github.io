This paper presents a Bayesian modeling approach to estimate disease prevalence and determine sample size requirements in free-ranging wildlife populations. 
Traditional methods for calculating sample sizes assume independent disease transmission among individuals, which isnâ€™t realistic in clustered wildlife populations
where disease spread often occurs within family groups or shared habitats. This new approach takes into account the natural clustering and correlation in disease
status among individuals, which can impact sample size needs.

Key findings include:

High within-cluster correlations can reduce sample size requirements, as sampling one individual in a correlated group may provide information on the rest.
However, if sampling focuses too much on specific small subsets within a population, high correlations can actually inflate sample size needs, as sampling 
multiple correlated individuals yields little additional information.
This flexible model can adapt to various species and sampling conditions, allowing for more accurate estimates in complex wildlife settings.
The study used Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD) in deer as a case study, where deer naturally group in families, increasing transmission risks. While the model
shows promise, practical challenges in achieving random sampling may still raise sample size requirements.

An online app is in development to help biologists determine appropriate sample sizes based on factors such as species behavior, social structure, and disease
characteristics. This tool aims to support wildlife monitoring efforts by making it easier to estimate disease spread in resource-limited settings, enhancing 
early detection and prevention of wildlife-origin diseases with potential human health impacts.
