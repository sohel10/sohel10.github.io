The paper titled "Earthquake Disaster Management Analysis in Dhaka" and examines the risks and preparedness for earthquake disasters in Dhaka, Bangladesh, a city situated in a highly tectonic region. Dhaka faces a high earthquake risk due to its position at the intersection of three tectonic plates, coupled with its dense population and vulnerable infrastructure. The study applies statistical methods, including correlation and multiple regression analysis, to assess disaster management in terms of occupancy types (residential, commercial, and industrial), essential facilities (medical care, emergency response, schools), and population distribution.
Medical and Emergency Services: The analysis finds a lack of adequate medical and emergency response facilities, indicating that Dhaka's existing infrastructure is insufficient for disaster response. This shortage implies that many residents may struggle to receive medical assistance in the aftermath of a major earthquake.
Schools show a positive correlation with residential, commercial, and industrial areas, suggesting that they could serve as temporary shelters. However, the study emphasizes the need for these buildings to be made earthquake-resistant.
