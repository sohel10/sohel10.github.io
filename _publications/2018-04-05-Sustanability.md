The paper "An Analysis of Housing Structures’ Earthquake Vulnerability in Two Parts of Dhaka City" by Md Sohel Ahmed and Hiroshi Morita investigates the vulnerability of various building types in Dhaka to earthquakes, focusing on Dhaka North City Corporation (DNCC) and Dhaka South City Corporation (DSCC). Due to rapid, unplanned urbanization, Dhaka is at high seismic risk, with many buildings lacking earthquake-resistant features. Using decision tree and random forest models, the study identifies key predictors of earthquake vulnerability, such as reinforced concrete structures and soft-story buildings. The findings indicate that reinforced concrete enhances resilience, while soft-story construction increases susceptibility to seismic damage. DSCC has older, less structurally sound buildings, making it more vulnerable than DNCC. The study underscores the urgent need for seismic retrofitting, especially for soft-story buildings, and suggests that strengthening building codes and awareness can help mitigate earthquake risks in Dhaka.
