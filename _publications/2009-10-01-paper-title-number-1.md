The paper titled "Earthquake Disaster Management Analysis in Dhaka" and examines the risks and preparedness for earthquake disasters in Dhaka, Bangladesh, a city situated in a highly tectonic region. Dhaka faces a high earthquake risk due to its position at the intersection of three tectonic plates, coupled with its dense population and vulnerable infrastructure. The study applies statistical methods, including correlation and multiple regression analysis, to assess disaster management in terms of occupancy types (residential, commercial, and industrial), essential facilities (medical care, emergency response, schools), and population distribution.

Key Findings:
Medical and Emergency Services: The analysis finds a lack of adequate medical and emergency response facilities, indicating that Dhaka's existing infrastructure is insufficient for disaster response. This shortage implies that many residents may struggle to receive medical assistance in the aftermath of a major earthquake.

Role of Schools: Schools show a positive correlation with residential, commercial, and industrial areas, suggesting that they could serve as temporary shelters. However, the study emphasizes the need for these buildings to be made earthquake-resistant.

Other Facilities and Open Space: Industrial facilities correlate positively with available resources, suggesting they may support disaster response. However, open space for evacuation is limited due to rapid urbanization, making it difficult to accommodate evacuees.

Population Distribution: There is a strong correlation between residential buildings and population distribution, particularly at night, indicating high residential density that would heighten the impact of a nighttime earthquake.
Conclusion:
The paper concludes that Dhakaâ€™s current earthquake disaster management framework is inadequate. Essential facilities like medical care and emergency response services are insufficiently equipped to handle a large-scale disaster. Although schools and other facilities could be used as temporary shelters, they must be made earthquake-resistant to ensure their effectiveness. The paper emphasizes the urgent need for government agencies and NGOs to improve coordination, expand open spaces, and strengthen disaster management infrastructure to better prepare Dhaka for potential earthquakes.
