The paper "Analysis of Essential Facilities and Occupancy Class for Earthquake Preparedness in Dhaka City" by Md. Sohel Ahmed and Hiroshi Morita focuses on assessing the earthquake preparedness of Dhaka, Bangladesh. Due to Dhaka's location near tectonic plate boundaries, the city is at high risk for earthquakes. This study examines the availability and correlation of essential facilities, such as medical care, emergency response, schools, and other critical infrastructure, in the Dhaka North City Corporation (DNCC) and Dhaka South City Corporation (DSCC) regions.

Key findings include:

Medical Care and Emergency Response: These facilities have a weak or no significant correlation with occupancy classes (residential, commercial, industrial buildings), indicating inadequate infrastructure for emergency response and medical care in both DNCC and DSCC. DSCC, in particular, is noted as lacking sufficient resources.

Schools: In DNCC, schools are significantly correlated with residential, commercial, and industrial buildings, whereas in DSCC, the relationship is weak. Schools can serve as temporary shelters post-disaster but require structural retrofitting for seismic safety.

Other Facilities: Industrial buildings show a positive relationship with the presence of other essential facilities, highlighting the potential for industrial areas to support disaster response efforts.

The paper concludes that Dhakaâ€™s emergency response and medical infrastructure need substantial improvements to handle potential earthquake disasters effectively. Prioritizing DSCC for facility upgrades is recommended to mitigate vulnerability. Further studies are suggested to analyze the quality of these essential services and enhance earthquake preparedness in Dhaka.
