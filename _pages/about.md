I am a dedicated and experienced Research Scientist with over 8 years of expertise in data science, specializing in Generative AI and machine learning. My work focuses on developing and implementing data-driven solutions across diverse domains, including public health and transportation. I am passionate about using advanced analytics to improve human health and well-being, leveraging technology and extensive datasets to uncover insights that drive impactful decision-making.

In my current role as a Research Scientist at the Texas A&M Transportation Institute, I lead initiatives utilizing Generative AI and automation to streamline processes within the Texas Transportation Department (TXDOT). My projects involve the development of applications that enhance data management and enable real-time insights for stakeholders, including a comprehensive medical chatbot powered by LangChain and AWS infrastructure. My work has also involved creating complex budget planning systems, automating data extraction and analysis for historical data insights, and deploying live spatial dashboards to visualize data across regions.

Prior to Texas A&M, I served as a Postdoctoral Associate at Cornell University, where I focused on modeling infectious diseases and wildlife health. I developed machine learning models to predict Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD) prevalence and conducted SARS-CoV-2 hotspot analyses in New Yorkâ€™s white-tailed deer populations. My research contributed to understanding disease transmission patterns, enabling informed decisions to manage health risks. I also applied machine learning in geospatial contexts, assessing environmental impacts on wildlife and contributing to policy insights.

My academic journey includes a Ph.D. in Information Science from Osaka University, where I was recognized with a Journal Yearly Best Paper Award. My research has consistently emphasized rigorous statistical and computational methods, applying them to real-world challenges. This drive to contribute meaningfully to public health has motivated my pursuit of funding, resulting in Proposed grants like the $100,000 award from the Center for Rural and Primary Healthcare to analyze infant mortality rates across South Carolina.

Beyond technical expertise, I am skilled in data visualization, survey design, and stakeholder management. My goal is to bridge the gap between data science and healthcare by developing intuitive solutions that integrate vast data resources with clinical insights, creating a future where data science directly enhances healthcare outcomes. I am excited to continue leveraging my skills and experiences to unlock the potential of data science in public health and beyond, transforming insights into actionable, real-world impact.
