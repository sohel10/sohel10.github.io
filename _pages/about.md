I am a dedicated and experienced Research Scientist with over 8 years of expertise in data science, statistical modeling, and machine learning, with a strong focus on Generative AI and its applications in healthcare and public policy. My research has spanned healthcare, public health, and transportation, where I have developed data-driven solutions to enhance decision-making and drive innovation. I am passionate about using advanced analytics to improve human health and well-being, leveraging technology and extensive datasets to uncover insights that drive impactful decision-making.

In my current role as a Statistician Staff Specialist at Michigan Medicine, University of Michigan, I lead statistical modeling and machine learning efforts for NIH-funded research projects. My work focuses on analyzing large-scale datasets, assessing health disparities, and applying predictive analytics to understand factors influencing cognitive health and dementia care. Additionally, I contribute to cross-country comparative analyses of healthcare systems and evaluate caregiving networks affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Previously, as an Assistant Research Scientist at Texas A&M Transportation Institute, I specialized in automation and Generative AI applications, developing AI-driven solutions for medical chatbot systems, data extraction pipelines, and real-time data visualization tools for the Texas Department of Transportation (TXDOT). My work also included budget planning automation, historical data analytics, and deployment of AI-powered applications using cloud-based infrastructures.

Before that, I worked as a Postdoctoral Associate at Cornell University, where I developed machine learning models for infectious disease modeling and geospatial analysis. My research contributed to predicting disease transmission patterns, such as Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD) in wildlife and SARS-CoV-2 prevalence in white-tailed deer populations. I also designed geospatial health models to assess the environmental impact on disease spread, contributing to policy recommendations and public health insights.

My academic journey includes a Ph.D. in Information Science from Osaka University, where I was recognized with a Journal Yearly Best Paper Award. My research has consistently emphasized rigorous statistical and computational methods, applying them to real-world challenges. This drive to contribute meaningfully to public health has motivated my pursuit of funding, resulting in Proposed grants like the $100,000 award from the Center for Rural and Primary Healthcare to analyze infant mortality rates across South Carolina.

Beyond technical expertise, I am skilled in data visualization, survey design, and stakeholder management. My goal is to bridge the gap between data science and healthcare by developing intuitive solutions that integrate vast data resources with clinical insights, creating a future where data science directly enhances healthcare outcomes. I am excited to continue leveraging my skills and experiences to unlock the potential of data science in public health and beyond, transforming insights into actionable, real-world impact.
